# Uninstall Module

Try uninstall the module in the normal way first:
- [Uninstall Standard Way](/FoxyFaceVRCFTInterface/install-update-uninstall/uninstall/Uninstall-Standard-Way.md)

<br />

## I can't remove the module or I can't say with certainty that I have removed it.

:::danger

The next steps will delete all of your VRCFT modules and settings.

There are times when a module won't uninstall in the standard way or you're completely confused because you've downloaded too many modules, in which case I can recommend a full VRCFT reset:
