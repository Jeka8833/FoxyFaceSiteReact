# Open VRCFT Data folder

:::warning

This instruction only works for **Windows**, if VRCFT starts supporting Linux or macOS, the directory paths will be different.

:::

Proceed one by one and you will be able to create or find the folder where the VRCFT data is stored:
1. Open `Roaming` folder (Here is a guide on how to find the `AppData` folder on [Windows 10](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/appdata-where-to-find-the-appdata-folder-in-windows-10/) or [Windows 11](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/locate-appdata-folder-on-windows-11/) for you, after this guide go to the `Roaming` folder if you are not already in it.)
2. Go to the `VRCFaceTracking` folder or [create a folder](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Folder-on-a-PC) if it does not exist.
