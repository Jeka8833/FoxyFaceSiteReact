# Installation and First Setup

## Let's make sure you're ready for further installation

1. You've connected a camera/webcam to your computer.

> If you don't have a webcam, you can use a phone or another computer as a camera. You can find
> instructions [here](/FoxyFace/connection/Using-another-device-as-a-camera.md).

2. You've found an avatar that supports face tracking or head rotation.

> You can find a test avatar for checking face tracking and head
> rotation [here](/FoxyFace/ui/vrcft/headrotation/Install-DeskyMode.md).<br />
> Instructions on how to find avatars can be found [here](https://youtu.be/aitYy5H9YTM).

3. The most important step is to make sure that you have
   enabled [OSC](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/intro/getting-started#3%EF%B8%8F-enable-osc-in-vrchat) in the avatar
   settings and enabled tracking of individual parts of the face/head; by default, this is all turned off.

## Installation

:::info

The installation order is important because the FoxyFace application must be launched before the FoxyFaceVRCFTInterface
module.

:::

1. Install and launch the FoxyFace application; instructions can be
   found [here](/FoxyFace/install-update-uninstall/install/Install-FoxyFace.md).
2. Install and launch the VRCFaceTracking application; the download link
   is [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3329480/VRCFaceTracking/).
3. If you plan to use the DeskyMode module for head rotation, you might need to install a different version of the
   application. You can find more information [here](/FoxyFace/ui/vrcft/headrotation/Head-Rotation.md).
4. Install the FoxyFaceVRCFTInterface module; instructions can be
   found [here](/FoxyFaceVRCFTInterface/install-update-uninstall/install/Install-Module-from-Module-Registry.md).
5. Update the neural network from Project Babble; instructions can be
   found [here](/FoxyFace/ui/babble/Update-Babble-Model.md).

## Improving tracking quality

1. Perform auto-calibration. Instructions can be found [here](/FoxyFace/ui/calibration/Auto-Calibration.md).
2. Adjust the camera (lighting, position, etc.). Instructions can be
   found [here](/FoxyFace/ui/camera/Camera-Settings.md).
