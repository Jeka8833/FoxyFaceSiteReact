1. **Turn off all [VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)** on the computer running VRCFT and on the computer running FoxyFace, if you know what a VPN is! Once you are able to establish a connection between VRCFT and FoxyFace you can try to enable VPN if you need it.
2. You will need to disable the Windows Firewall (Make Network Private) for the two computers. Here are the instructions for [Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/change-networks-to-private-on-windows-10-5185933) or [Windows 11](https://winaero.com/how-to-make-network-private-or-public-in-windows-11/).
