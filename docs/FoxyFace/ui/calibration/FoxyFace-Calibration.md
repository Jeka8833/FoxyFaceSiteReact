# FoxyFace Calibration

Parameter calibration offers two distinct methods:
1. [Auto Calibration](/FoxyFace/ui/calibration/Auto-Calibration.md) - this method involves tensing particular facial muscles to automatically calibrate the desired parameters.
2. [Manual Calibration](/FoxyFace/ui/calibration/Manual-Calibration.md) - with this method, you manually adjust parameters by entering values into dedicated fields.

If the cheek or tongue parameters are too unstable, consider [changing the filter settings for Project Babble's neural network](/FoxyFace/ui/babble/Babble-Settings.md#mincutoff--beta).

Although Auto Calibration is designed to cover most scenarios, Manual Calibration is essential for advanced needs, such as switching parameter sources or fulfilling other unique requirements. Head rotation can only be adjusted during Automatic Calibration.
