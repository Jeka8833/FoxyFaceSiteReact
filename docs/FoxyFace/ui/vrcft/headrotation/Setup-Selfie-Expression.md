# Setup Selfie Expression

:::info

The main problem is that one camera can be used by only one application (the camera in most cases cannot split the video stream between two applications). These instructions will help you split a video stream into two applications.

The author does not have a VRC+ so the instructions may contain mistakes or inaccuracies. 

:::

1. [Install OBS application](https://obsproject.com/). Video instructions can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGxdTGhhJyI), but you don't need to create any scenes, just install the app.
2. Close VRChat and FoxyFace app.
3. Add a camera to the OBS scene.
4. Click on the Start Virtual Camera button, [here](https://obsproject.com/kb/virtual-camera-guide) are instructions on how to do it.
5. Start VRChat and FoxyFace app.
6. Select the OBS camera in VRChat settings.
7. [Change Camera ID in FoxyFace.](/FoxyFace/ui/camera/Camera-Settings.md#camera-id)
