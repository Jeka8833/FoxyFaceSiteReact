# Install DeskyMode

:::info

This instruction requires you to be skilled in adding modules to avatars. Though installing the module is not that difficult, but it can be difficult to find a free avatar asset with face tracking.

:::

To track head rotation, follow these steps:
1. [Install DeskyMode module.](https://github.com/kusomaigo/DeskyMode)
2. [Install the most recent version of VRCFT.](https://download.foxyface.jeka8833.pp.ua/VRCFaceTracking.zip)
> This version is a compiled version of the [VRCFT master branch](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking) from GitHub. This version is newer even than the beta in Steam.
> 
> To install, unzip and read the "Installation instructions, read me.txt" file.
3. Enable and configure module to your liking in the DeskyMode menu within VRChat.

## Ready-made avatars

:::tip

You can try out avatars with the DeskyMode module already integrated. 

When using these avatars, you do not need to perform Step 1, but don't forget to complete Steps 2 and 3 from the instructions above, otherwise head rotation will not work.

You've modified an avatar and want to share it to help others? First, you need to confirm the original author is agreeable, then you can contact Jeka8833.
