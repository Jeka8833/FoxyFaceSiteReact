# Head Rotation

There are two methods of tracking head rotation. Here's a comparison table:

| Method                                                              | Pros                                                      | Cons                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [DeskyMode](https://github.com/kusomaigo/DeskyMode)                 | 1. Free<br />2. Low latency                               | 1. Requires the skill to embed modules into an avatar (There's a test avatar).<br />2. Does not allow control of the avatar's hands.          |
| [Selfie Expression](https://wiki.vrchat.com/wiki/Selfie_Expression) | 1. Works with all existing avatars<br />2. Tracking hands | 1. Requires [VRC+](https://wiki.vrchat.com/wiki/VRC%2B) (Paid) <br />2. Reportedly, it has high latency (unverified by the article's author). |

After you have seen all the pros and cons, choose either the DeskyMode or Selfie Expression option. Choose one of the instructions (You do not need to follow both instructions simultaneously):
- [Install DeskyMode](/FoxyFace/ui/vrcft/headrotation/Install-DeskyMode.md)
- [Setup Selfie Expression](/FoxyFace/ui/vrcft/headrotation/Setup-Selfie-Expression.md)
