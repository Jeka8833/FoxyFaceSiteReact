# Update FoxyFace

:::tip

The whole point of the update is to transfer the "config.json" file to the new version of the program. This file contains all program settings. If you don't care about the settings, you can safely delete all the FoxyFace files and then reinstall FoxyFace.

:::

:::danger

If you have other files stored together with FoxyFace program files that are not related to FoxyFace, do not delete them even if the instructions tell you to delete all files. You will have to deviate from the manual and adjust your actions yourself.

:::

1. Open the folder where you installed FoxyFace.<br />![AllFoxyFaceFiles](/images/FoxyFace/install-update-uninstall/AllFoxyFaceFiles.png)<br /><br />
2. Delete all files except “config.json”.<br />![UpdateConfigOnlyFile](/images/FoxyFace/install-update-uninstall/update/UpdateConfigOnlyFile.png)<br /><br />
3. [Perform the installation of FoxyFace](/FoxyFace/install-update-uninstall/install/Install-FoxyFace.md) in the folder where “config.json” remains. The result should be like this:<br />![UpdateResult](/images/FoxyFace/install-update-uninstall/update/UpdateResult.png)<br /><br />
4. Done, your settings have been successfully migrated and you have updated the program.
