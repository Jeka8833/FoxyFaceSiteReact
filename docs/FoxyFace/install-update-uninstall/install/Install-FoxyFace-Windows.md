## Error 0xc06d007e or similar
![FoxyFaceCrash](/images/FoxyFace/install-update-uninstall/install/FoxyFaceCrash.png)<br />

This error is most likely related to the fact that you are using an **outdated version of Windows** (all versions below **Windows 10**.0.19041 (**20H1**) are considered outdated). To solve this problem, there is a version of FoxyFace called FoxyFace-CPU-Only. It will not use your graphics card's hardware acceleration but will instead use your CPU, which can put a very heavy load on your computer if it is not powerful enough.

To run FoxyFace on an outdated Windows version, follow these steps:
1. Download the "FoxyFace-CPU-Only.zip" archive from [here](https://github.com/Jeka8833/FoxyFace/releases/latest).<br />![FoxyFaceCpuOnly](/images/FoxyFace/install-update-uninstall/install/FoxyFaceCpuOnly.png)<br /><br />
2. Follow steps 2-4 from the guide above.
